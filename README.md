## This CSS Portfloio challenge was created from the ground up using the knowledge I have gained (and retained) throughout bootcamp.
## I put into practice using anchor links to add a clickable url to a project image to direct me to correct URL.
## I attempted using different design elements throughout the CSS style sheet to design and layout my site accordingly. Although not as successful as I thought it was a great first step into learning and practicing what it takes to be a front end developer.
